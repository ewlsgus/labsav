# Library for Agent-Based Simulation Analysis and Visualization (LABSAV)

The Library for Agent-Based Simulation Analysis and Visualization (LABSAV) was created to organize my work in creating analyses and visualization scripts written in Python for analyzing gsd trajectory files from HOOMD-blue.

This library utilizes the following Python packages:

1. NumPy - <https://numpy.org/>
2. gsd - <https://gsd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html>
3. freud - <https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
4. OVITO - <https://www.ovito.org/>

I hereby disclose that this project was inspired by and adopted partial structures of the [Dragonfruit](https://github.com/cedelmaier/dragonfruit) project. Many thanks to [@cedelmaier](https://github.com/cedelmaier) for his work for the [Dragonfruit](https://github.com/cedelmaier/dragonfruit) project.
